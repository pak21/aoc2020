If you're using going to do a few of these puzzles, I'd recommend:

* [Day 7: Handy Haversacks](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)
* [Day 16: Ticket Translation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16)
* [Day 17: Conway Cubes](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17)
* [Day 18: Operation Order](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18)
* [Day 21: Allergen Assessment](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21)
* [Day 23: Crab Cups](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/23)

These are obviously focused on some of the later (=harder) puzzles, but
I think are the ones which involved some interesting concepts.
